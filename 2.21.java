//Non-linear Data Structures

//Tree-like Structures

Binary Trees:
	Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)
	C++: map/set/multiset
	Java: TreeMap/TreeSet
	map versions of the classes store (key,value) pairs
	the set versions of the classes store only keys
	the multiset allows duplicate keys
	AVL tree, Red-Black tree

	Binary Heap / Priority Queue
	Building from a collection: O(N)

Hash Table:
	lookups by key can be done in O(1)
	addition/removal done in O(1)
	unordered map in C++
	HashMap, HashSet, HashTable in Java
	HashTable (same type, same type)
	HashMap (K,V)
	HashSet(K)
